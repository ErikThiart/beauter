<h1>bol{;} <small>Methodology</small></h1>
<p>Beauter is based on an experimental methodology called <a href="https://bit.ly/designbol"><strong>bol</strong> by Shubham Ramdeo.</a></p>
<p>bol stands for <code>.base .-object ._layer</code>.
<p>Hence the naming concentions which are to be followed in Beauter as as follows:</p>
<blockquote><ol><li>All the basic base objects like html tags, and primary div classes are named directly like <code>.base {;}</code> in the CSS and can be accessed directly by <code>base</code>.</li>
<li>All the dependent objects and elements which cannot be used stand alone are named with a hyphen like <code>.-object {;}</code> in the CSS and can be accessed by <code>-object</code>.</li>
<li>All the independent utilities, modifiers and styling layers which can be mixed up together are named with an underscore like <code>._layer {;}</code> in the CSS and can be accessed by <code>_layer</code>.</li></ol></blockquote>
